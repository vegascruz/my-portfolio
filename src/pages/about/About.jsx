          <h3 className="text-xl py-2">
            Hi, my name is Vegas Cruz, and I am 24 years young. I am from Sparta, WI! If you don&apos;t know where that is, it&apos;s near La Crosse. Currently, 
          I live in Milwaukee with my beautiful girlfriend, Amanda Yenter.

          <h3 className="text-xl py-2">
            My favorite hobby/passion is Volleyball. I love sand doubles, and grass triples... someday, 
            I&apos;d like to live in California and play professionally. I also love to workout, my goal someday is a 40&quot; vertical. Lately, I&apos;ve rekindled my love for gaming. Love Call of Duty, 
            fighting games Mortal Kombat, and I also love RPG&apos;s like God of War and Dark Souls. I also love to watch TV, especially anime. Animes like Naruto, Dragonball, 
            Haikyuu, Bleach, and One Piece.

          <h3 className="text-xl py-2">
            My second goal someday is to be able to travel more... being a part time worker/student, I don&apos;t have the ability but that&apos;s a goal.
            I am currently in search for a Full-Stack or Web Developer job. I love front end, but am growing to understand/like backend more. 
            I fell in love with programming in High School where I took two programming classes. We learned C++ through Visual Studio. 
            We mostly worked on the command line, but I grew to love it the day I programmed a computer to say &quot;Hello World&quot;.

          <h2 className="text-3xl py-2 text-teal-600 font-medium dark:text-teal-400">Personality</h2>
          <h3 className="text-xl py-2">
            Let me tell you about my personality a bit. 
            I have the work ethic of a horse, except when it comes to doing dishes. I&apos;m fun, and have a very bubbly personality. I&apos;m kind and I treat people with respect... 
            my girlfriend says I&apos;m too much of a people pleaser, 
            but it&apos;s how I grew up.
